# DJI_Log_Plot
A quick script to graph the CSV files from DJI aircraft logs. 

This script takes the CSV file output from https://datfile.net/ software.
It generates a PDF containing one plot per page for each column of the CSV. 
It's intended to allow for quick-look analysis of the contents of the file.
